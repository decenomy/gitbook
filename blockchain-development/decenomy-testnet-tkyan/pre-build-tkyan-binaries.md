# Pre Build tKYAN Binaries

The latest tKYAN binaries are available on GitHub at [https://github.com/decenomy/DSW/releases](https://github.com/decenomy/DSW/releases), with versions compatible with Windows, macOS, Linux, and ARM systems.

Download them as you would with any wallet binaries and execute the Qt file or use the command line interface (CLI) as required.\
\
**Attention**\
As mention before this will run based on a KYAN branch, so without start the wallet with the testnet atribute, it will land on the KYAN blockchain and not on tKYAN blockchain, the testnet we want to achive.\
