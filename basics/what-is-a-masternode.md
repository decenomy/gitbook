# â–ª What is a Masternode?

A Masternode (MN for short) is a full node that meets certain criteria set by the blockchain network. \
It operates on a dedicated server with a static IP address, ensuring a high level of availability and reliability, and is only eligible if it meets the required amount of secured collateral.

A Masternode in the network performs some specialized tasks and enhances the functionality and security of the blockchain network. In exchange for providing such capabilities to the network, the MN owner receives a portion of the block reward.

## Masternode specialized tasks

A Masternode enhances the functionality and security of the blockchain network. \
They validate and store blocks of transactions, helping to maintain the integrity of the network's ledger and prevent malicious activities like double-spending playing this way a role in ensuring the security and immutability of the blockchain data.\
\
Masternodes can also help enhance the scalability and stability of the blockchain network. \
By offloading certain tasks and responsibilities from regular nodes, Masternodes help reduce the network's burden, improve performance, and ensure efficient operation even as the network grows.

## Collateral Required

Operating a masternode requires a collateral amount of the cryptocurrency's coin to be locked in a dedicated wallet. This collateral ensures that the Masternode owner has a financial stake in the network and discourages malicious behavior.

The amount of coins in the collateral is always provided by the blockchain and is a unique value that must be exactly as requested. Can't be more or less, must be the exact value, and must be done in a single transaction.\
\
A common question is whether the collateral allocated in a Masternode is lost forever. \
The answer is no. \
When you run a Masternode, the coins remain in your wallet. If you decide to stop running the Masternode, the coins become "unlocked" and can be freely used again.



## Rewards for running a Masternode

In order to reward the Masternode owner for running such an important feature for the network, a percentage of the block reward is delivered directly to the wallet from which the masternode was created (the wallet with the collateral).\
\
When considering running a Masternode as an investment allocation, things like ROI (Return on Investment) are important concepts to understand.\
&#x20;\
ROI is the percentage of initial investment that can be expected to earn back annually. \
\
Calculating ROI, in this case, involves several factors, such as the Masternode's collateral, the block reward, and the current number of Masternodes on the network.\
\
In general, as more Masternodes participate, the ROI decreases, while a decrease in the number of Masternodes leads to a higher ROI.\
\
It can be calculated as follows:\
\
ROI = (((MN reward per block x number of blocks in a year) / number of MN currently on the network)/ collateral amount)x100\
\
Information on the above points is always provided by the project.
