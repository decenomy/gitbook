# â–ª What is a Masternode?

A Masternode (MN for short) is a full node in a blockchain network that helps secure the network by consensus and improves the blockchain's functionality.

It operates on a dedicated server with a static IP address while ensuring a high level of availability and reliability. Furthermore, it is only eligible if it meets the required amount of secured collateral.

The MN owner is compensated for contributing to the network's capabilities with a portion of the block reward.

## Masternode Specialized Tasks

A Masternode enhances the functionality and security of a blockchain network. \
\
They validate and store blocks of transactions, helping to maintain the integrity of the network's ledger and prevent malicious activities like double spending, thus helping to ensure the security and immutability of blockchain data.\
\
Masternodes can also help improve the scalability and stability of the blockchain network.\
&#x20;\
By offloading certain tasks and responsibilities from regular nodes, Masternodes help reduce the network load, improve performance, and ensure efficient operation even as the network grows.

## Masternode Collateral Requirement

Operating a masternode requires a collateral amount of the cryptocurrency to be locked in a dedicated wallet. This collateral ensures that the Masternode owner has a financial stake in the network and discourages malicious behavior.

The amount of coins in the collateral is always stipulated by the blockchain and is a unique value that must be exactly as requested. The value must be exact, without any deviation, and it must be done in a single transaction.\
\
A frequently asked question is whether the collateral allocated in a Masternode is permanently lost. The answer is NO. When you run a Masternode, the coins remain in your wallet. If you decide to stop running the Masternode, the coins become "unlocked" and can be used again without restrictions.

## Rewards for Running a Masternode

To reward the Masternode owner for playing such an important role in the network, a percentage of the block reward is delivered directly to the wallet from which the masternode was created (i.e. the wallet with the collateral).\
\
When considering running a Masternode as an investment allocation, things like Return on Investment (ROI) are important concepts to understand. ROI is the percentage of initial investment that can be expected to earn back annually. \
\
Calculating ROI, in this case, involves several factors, such as the Masternode's collateral, the block reward, and the current number of Masternodes on the network. In general, as more Masternodes participate, the ROI decreases. On the other hand, a decrease in the number of Masternodes literally means a higher ROI.\
\
It can be calculated as follows:\
\
ROI = (((MN reward per block x number of blocks in a year) / number of MN currently on the network)/ collateral amount)x100\
\
Information on the above points is always provided by the project.
