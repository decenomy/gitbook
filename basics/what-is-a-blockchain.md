# â–ª What is a Blockchain?

A blockchain is a technology that is revolutionizing the way we store and manage digital information. \
\
Initially introduced alongside Bitcoin, the blockchain concept has since evolved beyond financial transactions.

## True blockchain definition

Imagine a record book that isn't controlled by a single authority but is distributed across multiple computers or nodes. Each transaction forms a block, and these blocks are linked in a chain, creating the blockchain.\
\
The extraordinary capabilities of this system lie in the way each block is linked to the previous one by a cryptographic hash. This mechanism ensures that once a block is added to the chain and verified, it becomes virtually impossible to alter or manipulate the information.\
This transparency and integrity add a whole new level of trust to the system.\
\
This technology also eliminates the need for intermediaries, such as relying on central institutions. This is because the blockchain operates on a network where every participant has a copy of the entire blockchain. This decentralized nature opens new possibilities for direct and trustless interactions between participants.\
\
Beyond cryptocurrencies, blockchain technology has found applications in other areas such as supply chain management, healthcare, voting systems, intellectual property, and more. \
\
For example, the addition of other software such as smart contracts, which are emerging with the blockchain bubble, will allow for self-executing agreements where pre-defined rules are encoded within the blockchain itself.



## Where DECENOMY stands

DECENOMY is a project network that shares the same wallet codebase and blockchain infrastructure, enabling cross-chain interoperability and governance among the DECENOMY projects. \
\
It uses a unique open-source cryptocurrency platform called DSW which stands for Decenomy Standard Wallet. The DSW is the central blockchain development for the entire infrastructure.\
\
DSW forked the PIVX code back in 2021 to inherit blockchain features such as POS ( Proof-of-Stake ) and Masternodes, which PIVX also inherited by forking DASH. As the main source of technology, DASH is also a Bitcoin fork code, thus providing all the main Bitcoin functionality and technology to the DSW blockchain code.\
\
Since then the DSW code has been developed independently from these forks, and it can be followed in its GitHub Repository at [<mark style="color:blue;">https://github.com/decenomy/DSW</mark>](https://github.com/decenomy/DSW)\

Some unique developments, new features added, and upcoming ones are all documented on this website in the chapter [<mark style="color:blue;">Blockchain Development</mark>](../blockchain-development/)
