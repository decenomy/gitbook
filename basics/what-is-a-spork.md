# â–ª What is a Spork?

Sporks are a feature that offers a way of implementing **upgrades** or **changes** to a blockchain network without requiring a hard or soft fork. Sporks allow the network to switch between the old and new rules at a specific block height or time, depending on the consensus of the nodes.

Sporks are different from forks, which are permanent changes to the network that require all nodes to upgrade or risk being left behind on an incompatible chain. Sporks are also different from soft forks, which are backward-compatible changes that do not require nodes to upgrade but may reduce their functionality.

## How do Sporks work?

Sporks work by allowing cryptocurrency developers to change some network parameters without requiring all nodes to upgrade their software. Sporks are literally switches that the developers can turn on or off using a special private key. Sporks can activate new features, fix bugs, or adjust network settings.

## What are the Benefits of Sporks?

* They allow for **faster and smoother** network upgrades without disrupting the network's normal operations.
* They give the developers more **flexibility and control** over the network parameters and features, allowing them to adjust them according to the changing needs and demands of the users.
* They reduce the risk of **network splits** or **chain reorganizations** when nodes disagree on the validity of blocks or transactions.
* They enhance the **security and stability** of the network by preventing malicious actors from exploiting bugs or vulnerabilities in the old code.
* They increase the **adoption and innovation** of the network by enabling new features and functionalities that may attract more users and developers.

## Some Examples of Cryptocurrencies using Sporks

* **Dash** is a digital currency that uses sporks to activate new features such as InstantSend and PrivateSend without disrupting the network.
* **Zcash** is a privacy-focused cryptocurrency that uses sporks to control the activation of network upgrades such as Sapling and Heartwood.
* **PIVX** is a fork of Dash that also uses sporks to implement changes and improvements to the network. PIVX stands for **Protected Instant Verified Transactions** and aims to provide fast, secure, and private transactions.
* **DSW is** a common platform used by **DECENOMY** and is a network of projects that share the same wallet codebase and blockchain infrastructure. DSW stands for **Decenomy Standard Wallet** and enables cross-chain interoperability and governance among the DECENOMY projects.
