In this guide we explain the main functions to use Decenomy wallets.

So let's open our Decenomy wallet (in this case the Trittium).

Now we are going to explain the following functions step by step

1. Home
2. Send
3. Receive
4. Contacts
5. Masternodes
6. Settings

**Home**

In the Home section we can see

* Total (the total of the coins owned)
* Available (the total amount of coins that can be spent)
* Locked (the total number of coins locked in the Masternodes)
* Immature (the coins that do not yet have enough confirmations to generate staking)
* Pending (coins received in unconfirmed transactions)

![](<../.gitbook/assets/2 (9).png>)

Also in the Home we can see more information

* All (you can see all transactions)
* Received
* Sent (transactions sent)
* Mined (coin mined or generated through mining)
* Minted (coin generated by staking)

In this other dropdown there is the following information

* Date desc (from the most recent to the oldest transaction)
* Date asc (oldest to newest)
* Amount desc (from largest to smallest transaction)

All DECENOMY coins use the same base code (DECENOMY standard wallet).

So this guide is valid for all DECENOMY coins!
