# Crypto (BTC) to Decenomy Coins

Earlier in the series on how to buy Decenomy coins with FIAT, we covered the [<mark style="color:blue;">account creation and verification</mark>](account-creation-and-verification-on-binance.md) process on Binance, and [<mark style="color:blue;">how to purchase Bitcoin (BTC)</mark>](fiat-to-crypto-btc.md) <mark style="color:blue;">with your bank card.</mark>&#x20;

Next in this series, we provide clear and concise steps to buy Decenomy coins after you've acquired Bitcoin on Binance. Without wasting much time, let's dive straight into the tutorial.

* In order to buy Decenomy Coins we now need to withdraw the Bitcoin on Binance to Birake exchange.

* After clicking '**Withdraw**,' you'll be taken to the withdrawal page. Here, you may notice that you're on the 'Withdraw Fiat' page.&#x20;
* To switch to 'Withdraw Crypto,' simply select the 'Withdraw Crypto' option located at the top right. Should you wish to withdraw fiat in the future, just simply switch back.

* At this point, we can see BTC is already selected as the coin we want to withdraw.
* We can also select Bitcoin from the network dropdown. However, at the moment we don't have a BTC address we want to withdraw, so we need to set up an account on Birake Exchange. Kindly refer to[ <mark style="color:blue;">User Account Creation and KYC Verification</mark>](../how-to-buy-decenomy-coins-on-birake/user-account-creation-and-kyc-verification.md) on Birake.

* Once you have your new Birake account verified, click on "Deposit/Withdraw" from the top menu to access the deposit page.

* From here we now need to select BTC from the dropdown list. Always double-check to ensure the correct coin is selected, as transactions cannot be reversed.
* Now we can see the BTC address to deposit to. We can select "Copy Address" or highlight the address and copy it. Ensure the complete address is copied

* Now that we have the address copied we can go back to Binance and paste it in there.
* Then double-check we still have Bitcoin selected as the network.
* Next, we can input how much we want to withdraw. In this case, we will select "MAX".
* You can then see the amount we will receive when we scroll down.
* When you are happy to continue, select "**Withdraw**".

* The time it takes for the transfer to happen can vary greatly with Bitcoin. Usually, if sent from Binance, you will get an email confirming it has been completed.
* After a while, we can go back to Birake and we can see the Bitcoin has arrived.

Once you have the Bitcoin credited to your Birake account, refer to [<mark style="color:blue;">How to Buy Decenomy Coins on Birake</mark>](../how-to-buy-decenomy-coins-on-birake/trade-buy-and-sell.md)<mark style="color:blue;">.</mark>&#x20;

We demonstrate how to exchange Bitcoin for Sapphire (SAPP). The same procedure can be applied to other Decenomy coins.
