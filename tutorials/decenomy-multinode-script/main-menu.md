On this first screen, we can perform 3 different operations.

* Select the coin we want to use
* Update the script
* Check which coins are installed on the system running this tool

### Coins to use

Each coin is referenced by a number so that it can be used. Simply enter the number assigned to each coin in the prompt below and press Enter.

### Update the script

This option can be used in case of a script update. The script will assist the user by reading the latest version presented on Github and the version currently installed on the system (the version in use). The user will then be prompted to decide whether to proceed with the upgrade.

### Already Installed

This feature provides an easy and fast way to determine which coin wallets have already been installed on the system through previous actions using this script and its own environment base.
