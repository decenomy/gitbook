# Menu Structure

Since this script serves the needs of all DECENOMY coins, the first screen of it is based on the selection of the coin we want to manage.\
\
Only after the previous step, more options are available, always taking into account whether the coin is already installed in the system or not. Full option availability only after the coin is installed.\
