#### Step 3

* Before proceeding to open a ticket, you have to quickly check the resources Flits has collated to see if your query has already been answered.
* For example, we can decide to go to '**FAQs**' to read the frequently asked questions related to masternodes

#### Step 4

* Let's choose, '**How long does it take to receive masternode rewards**?'
