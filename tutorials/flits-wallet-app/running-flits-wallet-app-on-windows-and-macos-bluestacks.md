# â–ª Running Flits Wallet App on Windows and MacOS - Bluestacks

### Step 1

* To begin, we will need to download and save the Flit Wallet App APK file from [https://flitswallet.app/](https://flitswallet.app/) onto our PC&#x20;

### Step 2

* Next, we also need to download and install the BlueStacks version 4 [https://www.bluestacks.com/download.html](https://www.bluestacks.com/download.html)
* For macOS users, you will proceed to download the appropriate version for your computer.
* However,  Windows users must check if Virtualization is enabled on their Windows computer. This will determine the specific version 4 they need to download.&#x20;
* We do this by opening **Task Manager** using `ctrl + alt + delete` keys. Switch to '**Performance**' and under **CPU**, you will find the status as indicated in the image below:

* If Virtualization is enabled, you may download the '**Nougat 64-bit'** version. Otherwise, you can turn it on if your PC supports virtualization. [<mark style="color:blue;">**How to Enable Virtualization on Windows**</mark> ](https://support.bluestacks.com/hc/articles/360058102252?locale=en-us)
* On the other hand, you will need to download and install the '**Nougat 32-bit'** version if your PC does not support virtualization.
