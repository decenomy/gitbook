# ðŸ”¸ How to restore a backup from an USB stick

{% embed url="https://youtu.be/XipzjQdzZU0" %}

First of all we insert our USB stick into the PC. After that we open the USB stick folder and we navigate to the backup file.

Letâ€™s now copy the file

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/0 (2)>)

After that we have to navigate to the wallet data directory located in %appdata% as shown in the picture (Windows 11).

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/1 (3)>)

We can now open the coinâ€™s folder we are looking for (in our case Sapphire)

![](../../.gitbook/assets/2)

**NB The file name must always be wallet.dat** so we need to rename the old one first.

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/3 (1)>)

We can now paste the file we copied previously from the USB stick\


![](<../../.gitbook/assets/4 (3)>)\


As final step we rename the file to wallet.dat

![](<../../.gitbook/assets/5 (2)>)

The wallet is restored and we can start our Sapphire wallet.

**NB As already mentioned make sure the wallet file name is wallet.dat otherwise your wallet will not recognize it.**\
**Do not move or rename other files or data directory.**
