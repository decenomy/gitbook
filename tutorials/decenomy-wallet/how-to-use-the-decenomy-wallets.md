# â–ª How to use the DECENOMY wallets

{% embed url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A2euj-G-CDA" %}

So let's open our Decenomy wallet (in this case the Sapphire wallet).

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/open sapp wallet.PNG" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Now we are going to explain the following functions step by step

1. Home
2. Send
3. Receive
4. Contacts
5. Masternodes
6. Settings

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/functions.PNG" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Home**

On the "HOME" window, we can see the following:

* Total (the total of the coins owned)
* Available (the total amount of coins that can be spent)
* Locked (the total number of coins locked in the Masternodes)
* Immature (the coins that do not yet have enough confirmations to generate staking)
* Pending (coins received in unconfirmed transactions)

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/home.PNG" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

The HOME window also provides transaction history and a means to filter the results:

* All (you can see all transactions)
* Received
* Sent (transactions sent)
* Mined (coin mined or generated through mining)
* Minted (coin generated by staking)
* MN reward (coin generated by the masternode)
* To yourself (transactions sent to ourselves)

Through this filter, we can only view the transactions that interest us.

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/wallet - filter.PNG" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Beside the filter is the dropdown menu for sorting. We have the following options at our disposal:

* Date desc (from the most recent to the oldest transaction)
* Date asc (oldest to newest)
* Amount desc (from largest to smallest transaction)
* Amount asc (from smallest to largest)

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/filter 2.PNG" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

On the far right section of the HOME window, we can see the following:

* Synchronized Block (shows us the status of the wallet synchronization)

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/synchronize blocks.PNG" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* Staking active (indicates if staking is active)
* Staking disabled (staking is disabled)

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/staking active.PNG" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* sapphire.conf (used to open the wallet configuration file)

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/sapp config.PNG" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* masternode.conf (used to open the masternode configuration file)

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/masternode conf.PNG" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* Debug Console (to manually give commands to the wallet)

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/debug console (1).PNG" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* Active connection(s) (the active connections in our wallet)

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/active connections.PNG" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* Unlocked Wallet (used to unlock the wallet for any operation)
* Lock Wallet (used to lock the wallet)
* Staking Only (the wallet is unlocked only to allow staking)

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/lock -unlock.PNG" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* Dark Theme (used to switch from dark to light theme and vice versa)

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/dark theme.PNG" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/faq.PNG" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* All visible (used to reveal or hide wallet details)

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/all visible.PNG" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

* Total Hash Rate (the total hash rate of the blockchain in question)
* Masternodes (shows the number of masternodes created and if they are running or not)
* Wallet Hash Rate (hash rate of wallet when staking is active)
* Collateral (value of current collateral)

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/masternode details.PNG" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

In this section of the HOME window, we find the statistics of both staking and masternode rewards.

* Add recipient (used to add additional recipients)

<figure><img src="../../.gitbook/assets/add recipient.PNG" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

As we can see, a field has been added where you can enter both the address and the number of coins for a second recipient of our SAPP.

On the right, we find three dots where there is the option to add or remove this address from the contacts.

### **Masternodes**

On the masternodes window, we can check the status of our masternodes and access some functions for their control.

* Info (used to see the information of your masternode)

Here are some of the masternode states

**ENABLED:** Your masternode has been enabled and is running on the network

**ACTIVE:** Your masternode has been activated and is running on the network

**NEW\_START\_REQUIRED:** Your masternode needs to be restarted. Go to your local wallet and start your masternode

**EXPIRED:** Your masternode is not on the network. Simply restart the alias and wait 15 minutes. If that doesn't work, set up your masternode from scratch using a new transaction ID
