In case we have problems connecting our wallet to the blockchain we need addnodes (peers).

In this guide, we will explain in a few simple steps how to add peers to your wallet.

First of all, let's open our wallet (in our case Sapphire)

Now we go to the top right and we will see the configuration file icon (in our case sapphire.conf).

As seen in the following picture

Now click on the configuration file icon to open it.

In case Windows asks us which program we want to use to open it, it is advisable to choose Notepad.

Now we go to [https://explorer.decenomy.net/](https://explorer.decenomy.net/) and search for the coin. (in this case Sapphire).

Then we click on the coin to access the "Overview" page.

As we can see on the next screen, we can choose "**Network**" from the left menu.

Now we choose from the list the option that corresponds to the version of our wallet (in this case 1.5.2.1)

**The version of our wallet can be found at the bottom left when the wallet is opened.**

Now we click on the "node list" button next to our preferred wallet version, this window will open and we copy the addnodes.

We go back to the Notepad to paste the addnodes.

Now we can save and close the configuration file as seen in the picture below:

Once this is done, we close and restart our wallet to apply the changes.\
Now our wallet is ready to be used!
